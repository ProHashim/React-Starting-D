# Getting Started with Create React App

` ReactDOM.render()`

ReactDOM.render() is used to render HTML on a webpage

ReactDOM.render() takes two args the HTML code and HTML element

For example: Displaying a paragraph
ReactDOM.render(JSXVariable/HTML element here, document.getElementById('root'));

`JSX` <br>
JSX stands for Javascript XML
It allows us to write HTML in React

`React Component` <br>
Components are independent and reusable bits of code. It works in isolation, same as our header.jsx in the `src` folder

<p>
`PROPS` <br>
Props are arguments passed into React components.

Props are passed to components via HTML attributes.

</p>

<p>
`State` <br>
React components has a built-in state object.

The state object is where you store property values that belongs to the component.

When the state object changes, the component re-renders.
